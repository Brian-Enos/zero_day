# **Vagrant Project (Optional)**
## **Introduction**
Vagrant is an open-source tool used for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.

It allows developers to easily create and configure lightweight, portable, and reproducible virtual machines.

Vagrant uses a simple configuration file to specify the virtual machine's settings, including the operating system, software packages, networking, and storage.

Vagrant supports various virtualization technologies, including VirtualBox, VMware, and Docker, allowing developers to choose the one that best suits their needs.

Vagrant also integrates with provisioning tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet, enabling developers to automate the installation and configuration of software on the virtual machine. Overall, Vagrant simplifies the process of setting up and managing development environments, making it easier for developers to focus on writing code.


## **Resources**

* [Virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
* [man uname](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uname)









# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google and to understand:

* What is a virtual machine
* What is Vagrant
* Who wrote Vagrant
* What is Ubuntu
* What does “Ubuntu” mean
* How to use VMs with Vagrant
* What does the command *uname* do

## **Requirements and Instructions**


* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x00-vagrant), describing what this project is about


# **More Info**
## **Installing Git**
If git is not already installed on your terminal:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
Basic usage
At the end of this project I was to  be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

```
$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```
## **Warning**
This project couldn't be done in Sandboxes - it could only be done  in my local computer.



## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about software engineering  or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
